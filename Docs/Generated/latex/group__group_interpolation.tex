These functions perform 1-\/ and 2-\/dimensional interpolation of data. Linear interpolation is used for 1-\/dimensional data and bilinear interpolation is used for 2-\/dimensional data.

\mbox{\hyperlink{group___linear_interpolate}{Linear Interpolation}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Linear interpolation is a method of curve fitting using linear polynomials. Linear interpolation works by effectively drawing a straight line between two neighboring samples and returning the appropriate point along that line. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
\mbox{\hyperlink{group___bilinear_interpolate}{Bilinear Interpolation}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Bilinear interpolation is an extension of linear interpolation applied to a two dimensional grid. The underlying function {\ttfamily f(x, y)} is sampled on a regular grid and the interpolation process determines values between the grid points. Bilinear interpolation is equivalent to two step linear interpolation, first in the x-\/dimension and then in the y-\/dimension. Bilinear interpolation is often used in image processing to rescale images. The C\+M\+S\+IS D\+SP library provides bilinear interpolation functions for Q7, Q15, Q31, and floating-\/point data types. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
