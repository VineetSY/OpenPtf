\mbox{\hyperlink{group___p_i_d}{P\+I\+D Motor Control}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em A Proportional Integral Derivative (P\+ID) controller is a generic feedback control loop mechanism widely used in industrial control systems. A P\+ID controller is the most commonly used type of feedback controller. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
\mbox{\hyperlink{group__clarke}{Vector Clarke Transform}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Forward Clarke transform converts the instantaneous stator phases into a two-\/coordinate time invariant vector. Generally the Clarke transform uses three-\/phase currents {\ttfamily Ia, Ib and Ic} to calculate currents in the two-\/phase orthogonal stator axis {\ttfamily Ialpha} and {\ttfamily Ibeta}. When {\ttfamily Ialpha} is superposed with {\ttfamily Ia} as shown in the figure below. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
\mbox{\hyperlink{group__inv__clarke}{Vector Inverse Clarke Transform}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Inverse Clarke transform converts the two-\/coordinate time invariant vector into instantaneous stator phases. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
\mbox{\hyperlink{group__park}{Vector Park Transform}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Forward Park transform converts the input two-\/coordinate vector to flux and torque components. The Park transform can be used to realize the transformation of the {\ttfamily Ialpha} and the {\ttfamily Ibeta} currents from the stationary to the moving reference frame and control the spatial relationship between the stator vector current and rotor flux vector. If we consider the d axis aligned with the rotor flux, the diagram below shows the current vector and the relationship from the two reference frames\+: \end{DoxyCompactList}\item

\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Inverse Park transform converts the input flux and torque components to two-\/coordinate vector. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
